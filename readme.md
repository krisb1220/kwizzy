# Kwizzy App

This is going to be a simple WYSIWYG quiz/form builder app. It will have:


## TODO
+ Create more intutitive & practical database schema
+ Unit tests because retyping the same stuff for testing is getting on my nerves 
+ Everything else

## Short-term goals:
+ Login & Auth
+ Ability to build a form with multiple input types (radio, checkboxes, short text, long text, etc)
+ A simple layout system 
+ "News feed" 
+ "Profile" page
+ Ability to submit forms 

## Goals
+ Convert frontend to React
+ Ensure proper security 

## Current state
There are currently 3 endpoints -
+ `GET /`
+ `POST /SIGNUP`
+ `POST /LOGIN`
